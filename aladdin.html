Disney - Aladdin History
<h1/>
<p class = "text">
Aladdin is a 2019 American musical fantasy film directed by Guy Ritchie and written by John August.
 As a live-action adaptation of the 1992 animated film of the same name, the film was released 
 by Walt Disney Pictures on May 24, 2019. The plot follows Aladdin, a street urchin who falls in love
 with Jasmine, befriends a wish-granting Genie, and battles the wicked Jafar.
In October 2016, Disney announced Ritchie would direct a live-action Aladdin remake. Smith was the first 
member of the cast to join, signing on to portray Genie in July 2017, and Massoud and Scott were 
confirmed for the two lead roles later that month. Principal photography began that September at Longcross
Studios in Surrey, England, also filming in the Wadi Rum Desert in Jordan, and lasted until January 2018.
Additional filming and pick-ups took place in August 2018.
